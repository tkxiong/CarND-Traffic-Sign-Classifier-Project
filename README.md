# **Traffic Sign Recognition Program using TensorFlow**

The aim of this project was to accurately classify traffic signs from the [German Traffic Signs dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset) by means of a convolutional neural network.

**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Neural Network**

Here are the steps I followed:
* Load the dataset
* Explore, summarize and visualize the dataset
* Pre-process, balance and augment the dataset
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images

You can view my workflow in Traffic_Signs_Classifier.ipynb.
